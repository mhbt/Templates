							<h2 class="title">OVERVIEW</h2>
							<p>Imagine a neighborhood where there’s a guard on every street, watching over your home, your kids as they play in the street, and reporting suspicious activity to police. Sounds like a pretty safe place to live, right? The problem is, live security
								guards aren’t available everywhere, they get sick, they miss details, and they’re expensive and plain security cameras just confirm something bad already happened. What if you could use modern technology to prevent unwanted activity? Unwanted
								activity includes theft, speeding vehicles, vandalism, and unknown persons wandering the premises. The Green Zone is a crowd-sourced, smart neighborhood that is monitored and managed 24/7 by AlarmTransfer’s operations center. This is a virtual
								guard system that elevates the security of entire neighorhoods through persistent surveillance and live intervention. A threat is detected and an operator intervenes, immediately. Finally, you have a chance to stop bad things before they happen!</p>

							<h2 class="title">HOW IT WORKS</h2>
							<p>The HOA chooses a deployment option - House-to-House or Mesh Network. Cameras are mounted to each home, facing the street, or mounted to lamp posts throughout the neighborhood. Every camera in the neighborhood is connected to hub that allows the
								enrolled homeowners to access all camera footage, anytime, from anywhere. Advanced video analyics are used to trigger alarm events that live operators respond to by viewing the camera feeds and either speaking directly to the intruder, or reporting
								suspicious activity directly to local police. Homeowners get access to every camera in the neighborhood for what it would traditionally cost that person to subscribe to cloud video storage for a single camera!</p>

								<p>On contract signing, AlarmTransfer will engage governing members of the HOA to build a communication plan to homeowners. Camera installation at the entrances must be scheduled 2 weeks in advance and depends on power and internet service installation.
									Duration estimate for physical camera installation at the entrances is 2 days. Camera configuration and testing will be estimated in the quote. AlarmTransfer will provide three (3) camera options for homeowners and present the options to the
									HOA. There will be a minimum quality standard that must be maintained to ensure integrity of the video and monitoring service. However, some homeowners may opt to pay a premium for a “better” camera. AlarmTransfer will help craft the message
									to homeowners and provide a registration page on our website to enroll homeowners. The HOA will be responsible for directing the homeowners to the registration page and driving adoption by the community. This helps eliminate unwanted solicitation
									from negatively impacting the community. Details will be FInalized during this phase of the project.</p>

							<h3 class="mb-4">Monitoring</h3>
							<p>Once a camera is enrolled, it becomes part of a monitored system of sensors. AlarmTransfer’s operations center is conducting virtual guard tours and responding to event-based alerts triggered by The Green Zone, 24/7/365. This is a form of persistent
								surveillance that is used in fusion cells and command centers in many major cities with great success. AlarmTransfer consolidates the scope into single neighborhoods. Over time, patterns of life are “learned” into the video analytics platform
								and the system becomes more intelligent. Each camera is watching the street and the house across the street with all windows masked for privacy. The AlarmTransfer operations center continuously configures the video analytics platform to “learn”
								normal activity for the neighborhood. Other analytics can be enabled, such as vehicle speed detection. This activity triggers alerts inside the operations center and helps AlarmTransfer report real-time intelligence to local law enforcement. Threat
								alerts can be automatically e-mailed or transmitted via SMS to homeowners. For example, when a suspicious person is spotted during a virtual guard tour, the AlarmTransfer operations center can release a snapshot of the person with a brief description
								of activity to all homeowners. Parents with children playing outside have an extra set of eyes with The Green ZoneTM.</p>

								<h3 class="text-center mb-5">Maintenance/Support Phase</h3>
								<p>Technical support and troubleshooting will be provided directly to the homeowner by AlarmTransfer for the life of the service contract. For the House-to-House option, each homeowner must sign an individual monitoring agreement that authorizes
									“public” access to the camera feed of the enrolled camera and authorizes AlarmTransfer to access the camera via secure, remote connection in order to perform camera maintenance, firmware upgrades, reconfiguration, remote reboot, etc…</p>
								<p>Unlike typical commercial and residential monitored camera deployments, there is no hourly rate assessed to troubleshoot problematic cameras enrolled in The Green ZoneTM program. AlarmTransfer is responsible for routine care and maintenance of
									the cameras and ensuring they’re functioning properly in the overall system. AlarmTransfer is responsible for maintaining uptime of the mesh network and will do so at no additional cost to the HOA. Replacement hardware that is required do to
									end-of-life or damages from vandalism, theft, or natural disaster will be billed to the HOA. Leasing options are available to combine the cost of hardware, software, and services and spread the total cost over a term, such as 5 years. After the
									lease term, the monthly obligation to the HOA would be reduced to only monitoring fees.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="tgz-effectiveness mb-5">
								<h2 class="title">How Effective is The Green Zone</h2>
								<p>"A pilot program for public surveillance was initiated in Baltimore in 2005 to observe the impact of modern security systems on rising crime rates. The neighborhoods involved in the program were known for having a high level of criminal activity.
									Four months after the cameras were put into place, the crime rate decreased by approximately 30 incidents per month. The number held steady for the following three years which clearly shows that the installation of surveillance cameras played
									a major hand in lowering criminal activity in crime prone neighborhoods of Baltimore. According to researchers, the estimated benefits of averting the crimes in Baltimore (savings in criminal justice costs) outweighed the costs of setting up
									and operating the surveillance system. "</p>
								<p>The Green Zone is the most advanced, well optimized and comprehensive neighborhood surveillance system available in the country today. If the pilot program could help bring down crime rates in Baltimore, then one can only wonder how effective
									The Green Zone will be in keeping neighborhoods safe and secure. </p>
